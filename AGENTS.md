# Agent Instructions

## Commits MUST Follow Conventional Commits

Every commit in this repository MUST follow
[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). Write the subject
as `<type>(<optional scope>): <short imperative description>`.

- Allowed types: `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `test`, `refactor`, `perf`,
  `build`, `ci`, `style`, `revert`.
- Write the description in the imperative, in lower case, without a trailing
  full stop.
- Put ticket keys in the body or footer as `Jira: <TICKET-KEY>`, never in the
  subject.
- Mark breaking changes with `!` before the colon or with a
  `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer.
- Use the same pattern for squash-merged pull request titles.

## Start Here
